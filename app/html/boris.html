                <b>School:</b> Penn State University<br>
                <b>Graduation Date:</b> December 2017<br>
                <b>Major:</b> Math & Statistics<br>
                <b>Hobbies:</b> Philanthropy & running<br>
                <b>What I learned during this internship:</b> I had the chance to build on some of my skills in Visual Basics,
                writing some macros to help with Level of Effort Estimations. I also had the opportunity to work with pulling
                data from rally server and populating a mySQL database. Moving forward, I worked with others on Team 2 in order to
                provide scrum masters and ultimately senior leadership with data on all teams' performances. </br>
                <b>What I loved about this internship:</b> The people in the office were incredible to work with throughout
                the summer. "Office culture" is something you hear a lot about at most companies, but it's pretty incredible
                to see individuals get along with one another while maintaining such a high level of productivity.</br>
