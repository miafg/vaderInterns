                <p>
                    <b>School:</b> Cornell University<br>
                    <b>Graduation Date:</b> May 2019<br>
                    <b>Major:</b> Biomedical Engineering & Computer Science<br>
                    <b>Hobbies:</b> Bowling, basketball, good question, photography, watching TV, playing the piano<br>
                    <b>What I learned during this internship:</b> Throughout my time with Team 4, I learned about Cassandra and SOLR,
                        working specifically on automating database deployments and applying SOLR core commands. I also
                        learned a lot about how to use the Spring framework, an invaluable tool that I hope I will use
                        in the near future.</br>
                    <b>What I loved about this internship:</b> Although Comcast is a huge company, I really loved the
                    togetherness and community that the VADER team shared. From the first day of my internship, I immediately
                    felt welcomed by the team. The amount of support that I was offered was really incredible and I appreciate it very much.</br>
